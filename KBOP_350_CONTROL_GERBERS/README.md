This folder contains a fritzing file (I know, groan ...), the resulting gerber files and BOM file in case you want to roll  
your own board or send it off to a fab house. I used OSHPark. The project link is [here](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/PDBvR61N)  

Also included are the zipped gerbers you can upload directly ...
